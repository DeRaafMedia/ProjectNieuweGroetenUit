ProjectGroetenUitNederland
==========================

Played a little roll in a nation wide Traveling photo exposition 'Nieuwe Groeten Uit Nederland' (New Greetings From The Netherlands). One of my photo's was used to illustrate the 'air castle'.

I'm an avid admirer of the Enschedese School of art's (http://goo.gl/xs1fMv). In short it's was a group of artist that made art that was send via the post. I do a lot with the concept "post" in my photograpy.

This was an exposition organized by the FOAM (http://www.foam.org), ANP (http://www.anp.nl/about-us/) and the Nationaal Historisch Museum (NHM) (The National Historical Museum, I know it's unbelievable, but it doesn't exist anymore in the Netherlands).
